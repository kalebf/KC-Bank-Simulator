# KC-Bank-Simulator
This project is a basic command-line simulation of a bank, where users can perform simple banking operations.
Deposit Funds: Allows users to add money to their account.
Withdraw Funds: Enables withdrawals as long as there are sufficient funds in the account.
Check Balance: Displays the current account balance.
Exit: Ends the session with the bank.
The initial account balance is set to $1,000, and the program runs in a loop until the user selects the "Exit" option. Input validation ensures users select valid options from the menu and prevents overdrafts during withdrawals.

How to Run: Simply run the Python script in a terminal or command line. The program will prompt you to choose an operation, perform the selected task, and then display the updated balance.
